we can put only expressions in curly brackets

React updates only the code written '{}'.



React components takes arbitrary inputs as attributes and returns react elements (jsx expressions).

(if we doesn't pass a property name it doesn't render the object.)

=> All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.

component is a block of code which takes parameters(props) are returns hierarchy of views.

state is considered to be private to a component that defines it, we cannot update the Boardâ€™s state directly from Square
(parent to childern when an action performed on a childComonent)

immutability!
